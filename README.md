'https://api.the-odds-api.com/v3/sports'

This is the API Im working with, my test file contains some basic interactions with it.
My schema is pretty much what is in the spert.png picture though Im going to add a row in the books table to track for worst odds as well as best odds, that way I can keep data on better perfomers.
I will add similar data row to teams DB to keep track of biggest underdogs and favorites
